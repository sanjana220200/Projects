#ML PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The use of data-driven strategies is becoming increasingly prevalent in business organizations as a means of generating profits. In this research paper, we examine the application of k-means clustering for customer market segmentation in the context of bank data. Our goal is to identify distinct groups of customers within a bank's client base in order to more effectively target marketing efforts and improve customer retention.
To achieve this, we first preprocess the bank transaction data to extract relevant features that can be used to represent customer behavior. These features are then fed into a k-means clustering algorithm, which divides the customers into clusters based on similarities in their feature vectors. 
Various metrics were used to validate the effectiveness of our approach. We also provide visualizations of the resulting clusters to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of each cluster and how they differ from one another.
Our results demonstrate that k-means clustering is a valuable tool for customer market segmentation in the context of bank data. Banks can utilize these methods to target users and improve their marketing efforts. In addition, the insights gained from the resulting clusters can inform the development of more personalized products and services, further enhancing the customer experience.
